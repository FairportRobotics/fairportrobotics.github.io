# How To Make A Repository
### With Github:
Make an account on [Github](https://github.com). If you want to make a repository in the Team organization, make sure you are added. Click the plus sign on the top right of the screen next to your profile and follow the steps to create the repository.
### With Git:
This is something you will not do often as its much easier to just create the repository on Github itself. \
\
The `git init` command makes a github repository from the current directory.\
Use `git init <directory>` to make a github repo from a given directory.\

I did not put a whole lot of info here because you will not use this a lot, but if you want to learn more, [check out here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-init).
