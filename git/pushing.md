# Pushing To A Repo
### Using Git
Pushing is how you move your code from your computer to the remote repository. \
To push new changes to a repository you use `git push <remote> <branch>`. \
Learn more about using git [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-push) (this will explain it better than I can).
### Using Github
More often than not, you will use git, but when that one time comes, using Github may be needed. To upload things to github, simply highlight your files and hover them over github. 
You can also click add files on the page and select the files you want to send. If you need to make small edits to a file, just go to the file on Github and click the edit button on the top right of the code.
