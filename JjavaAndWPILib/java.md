# What Is Java?
Java is a programming language that enables developers to create robust, high-performance applications. Java is platform independent, which means that it can run on any operating system, making it an ideal choice for developing cross-platform applications. Java is also widely used in web development and enterprise applications. We use Java to program our robots and control them.
# Where Can I Learn It?
There are many great ways to learn java. You can try looking at previous years code or take a course. Here are some recommended courses:
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com)

One thing to note, however, is that courses will not supply you with the WPILib knowledge. There will still be some things to learn after you learn the java syntax.
