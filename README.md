# Introduction
Welcome! On this wiki, you'll find a compilation of essentials and useful bits of knowledge to be on the Fairport Robotics Software/Programming Subteam (Just referred to as **"Software"** on our team).

Please take time to read through all of the material; it will be helpful both in that you will be able to contribute more to the robot and also in that you won't have to ask more experienced team members as many questions. While this is quite a lot of content, there's more about how you should go about reading this on the [About this guide page](about.md).
